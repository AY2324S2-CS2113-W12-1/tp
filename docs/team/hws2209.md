# Wan Sing's Project Portfolio Page

PlaNUS is a Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop app for students majoring under the Faculty of Engineering in NUS.
It serves as a centralized platform for our target user to manage their past, current, and future courses.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
- **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2324s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=hws2209&breakdown=true)

- **Enhancements implemented**: 
    - Updated code to enable `csv` data files to be included in the `jar` file generated by Gradle
    - Set up the logger
    - Implemented the `Course` and `Timetable` classes
        - What it does: Allows the user to add a course to the plan and remove a course from the plan
        - Justification: This forms the base for the whole app
        - Highlights: The year specified for a course has been restricted to 1 - 6, in line with the maximum 
          candidature period found [here](https://nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/undergraduate-students/continuation-and-graduation-requirements#ResidencyRequirement).
          The term specified has been restricted to 1 - 4, which includes 2 semesters and 2 special terms per year. 
          The number of modular credits has been restricted to 0 - 30, which is sufficient for an undergraduate course.
    - Implemented the `PlanGetter` class
        - What it does: Allows the user to view the plan
        - Highlights: Users can view the plan with both the year and term specified, with only the year, 
          or with nothing specified. This provides flexibility and convenience in usage.
    - Implemented the `display` feature
        - What it does: Allows the user to see the recommended schedules of various engineering majors 
          without overwriting their current timetable plan
        - Justification: This provides convenience for the user as before this feature was implemented, users have to 
          initialise their plans to see the recommended schedules, overwriting their current data
    - Updated Parser to check that command tags such as "y/" are correctly specified for `move course`, `view`, `check`

    - Added the `Non-Functional Requirements` section
